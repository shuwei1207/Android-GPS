With the Google Maps Android API, you can add maps to your app that are based on Google Maps data.
The API automatically handles access to Google Maps servers, data downloading, map display, and touch gestures on the map.
You can also use API calls to add markers, polygons and overlays, and to change the user's view of a particular map area.
The key class in the Google Maps Android API is MapView. 
A MapView displays a map with data obtained from the Google Maps service. 
When the MapView has focus, it will capture keypresses and touch gestures to pan and zoom the map automatically, including handling network requests for additional maps tiles. It also provides all of the UI elements necessary for users to control the map. 
Your application can also use MapView class methods to control the map programmatically and draw a number of overlays on top of the map.
